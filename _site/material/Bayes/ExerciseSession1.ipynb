When $\\alpha$ and (or) $\\beta$ become large enough the prior starts to affect the posterior inference and shifts the posterior interval towards the prior distribution. However, it is interesting to notice that for $\\alpha$ = 50 and $\\beta$ = 50, we have a prior mean of 0.5, close to the expectation we could have about the ratio of boys and girls births without having any knowledge.
