I am a tenured research scientist (CR) in the [EPIONE](https://team.inria.fr/epione/en/) team of Inria Sophia Antipolis and Université Côte d’Azur, and I have an affiliate position within the [School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis) at King’s College London (Visiting Senior Lecturer).  Prior to this, I was Research Associate in the Centre for Medical Image Computing at the University College London (UK), and Researcher at the Hospital San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli (Italy).

I obtained my BSc and MSc in Mathematics at Università degli Studi di Torino, and I obtained my PhD in Signal and Image Processing from Université de Nice. 

My research is on the study of statistical learning methods to model heterogeneous data in biomedical applications. With my team, we focus in particular in the modeling of disease progressions from multimodal biomedical data, to inform clinical decision and simulate intervention strategies. Our research is also in the analysis of multi-centric biomedical information, and in particular in the development of methods and software for collaborative learning in healthcare applications.
