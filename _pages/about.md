I am currently in M1, pursuing my MSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Université Côte d'Azur. I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from American International University-Bangladesh [(AIUB)](https://www.aiub.edu/). During my undergraduate studies, I completed my thesis on NLP under the supervision of Prof. [Md Kishor Morol](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kishormorol/). Additionally, I worked on two research projects in computer vision with Prof. [Md Shakhawat Hossain](https://iub.ac.bd/academics/departments/cse/faculty-and-staff/shakhawat).

Toward the end of my bachelor’s program, I interned as a Software Engineer at Mediasoft Data System Limited, where I gained hands-on experience in developing web applications using C# and the .NET framework. After graduating, I joined AIUB as a Research Assistant Intern in 2024. This role deepened my interest in artificial intelligence, allowing me to gain practical experience in building and training models, reviewing research papers, and assisting professors with organizing academic materials.

I later worked on graph algorithms with Prof. Dr. [Md Manzurul Hasan](https://www.aiub.edu/faculty-list/faculty-profile#manzurul@aiub.edu), where I contributed to solving an antimagic labeling problem. This experience sparked my interest in integrating graph theory with AI, shaping my current research focus.

At present, my primary research interests include agentic AI, computer vision, NLP and graph algorithms. However, I remain open to exploring new areas as I continue my academic journey.

Outside of academia, I am an enthusiast of sports, particularly football, badminton, and chess. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss any of these interests!
