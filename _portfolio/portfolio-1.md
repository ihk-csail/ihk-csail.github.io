One of my main research axis consists in studying the relationship between complex biomedical data, such as phenotypes quantified by neuroimaging (such as atrophy, or connectivity) and individual's -omics profile (e.g. large genetic arrays). This challenging research field requires the development of efficient and powerful statistical models for studying multivariate patterns of associations between mutimodal biomedical data.
