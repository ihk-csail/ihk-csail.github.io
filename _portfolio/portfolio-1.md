This research axis focuses on the study of the relationship between complex biomedical data, such as phenotypes quantified by neuroimaging (such as atrophy, or connectivity) and individual's -omics profile (e.g. large genetic arrays). To solve this problem, we develop efficient and flexible statistical models for studying multivariate patterns of associations between mutimodal biomedical data. 

For example, in the work
