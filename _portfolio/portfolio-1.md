One of my main research axis consists in studying the relationship between complex biomedical data, such as phenotypes quantified by neuroimaging (such as atrophy, or connectivity) and individual's -omics profile (e.g. large genetic arrays). This challenging research field requires the development of efficient and powerful statistical models for studying multivariate patterns of associations between mutimodal biomedical data. The circle plot on the left shows the genetic locations significantly associated to the brain cortical thinning shown on the right hand side.
