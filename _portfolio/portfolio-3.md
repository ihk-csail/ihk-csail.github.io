My research is on the theory and practical use-cases of federated learning (FL), with a special focus in healthcare applications. 
                Current topics include:

- Studying the statistical properties of aggregation mechanisms and clientsâ€™ sampling methods in heterogeneity FL setting
- Investigating robust FL methods with respect to clients' heterogeneity and attacks
- Developing the FL software [Fed-BioMed](https://fedbiomed.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) an open source project focused on empowering biomedical research using non-centralized approaches for statistical analysis and machine learning
