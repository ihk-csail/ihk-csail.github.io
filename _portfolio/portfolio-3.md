My research is on the theory and practical use-cases of federated learning (FL), with a special focus in healthcare applications. 
                Current topics include:
            <ul>
                <li> Studying the statistical properties of aggregation mechanisms and clientsâ€™ sampling methods in heterogeneity FL setting;</li>
                <li> Investigating robust FL methods with respect to clients' heterogeneity and attacks;</li>
                <li> Developing the FL software <a href="https://fedbiomed.gitlabpages.inria.fr/">Fed-BioMed</a>, an open source project focused on empowering biomedical research using non-centralized approaches for statistical analysis and machine learning;</li>
             </ul>
